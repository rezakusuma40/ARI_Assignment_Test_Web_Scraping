This repository comprises the assignment task I executed as part of my application process at PT. Asia Research Institute. The task necessitated the utilization of Beautiful Soup for scraping a standard website and Selenium for a dynamic website. While these programs may not be flawless, my tenure at PT. Asia Research Institute has significantly enhanced my skills, providing me with a substantial learning curve. I'm confident that I can develop considerably improved web scraping programs in the future.

Contained within this directory are the web scraping programs I authored, accompanied by their respective CSV-formatted results, and the PowerPoint slides summarizing the process and outcomes.
